# Frequent Itemsets Mining (FIM)

There are three directories wich correspond to different java/maven projects: <br>
  - Tutorial <br>
    This project contains basic instructions for using an already implemented Apriori algorithm with several sets
    
  - Flink <br>
    This project contains other algorithms for FIM implemented in Flink: Apriori, ECLAT, Rapriori
    
  - Spark <br>
    This project contains other algorithms for FIM implemented in Spark: Apriori, ECLAT (including versions for running in the cluster) and how to use the FP-Growth algorith available in Spark
